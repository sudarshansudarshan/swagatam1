We are trying to accommodate as many students as possible. There is no fixed cap. We will make a decision based on the number of participants.

**3. Can parents come, or should only the students attend alone?**

Parents are welcome to join their kids, but they should arrange their own accommodation outside the campus. There are a few good hotels in the Ropar district.

All students will be provided with shared accommodation. They will get a good glimpse of what it means to stay in the hostels of an IIT.
