## Introduction  
---
In the initial stages of this course we will be broadly covering four topics namely Linear Algebra, Multivariable Calculus, Data Analysis and Statistics.  

## Learning Outcomes
---
We focus on a skill-based learning approach that fosters a deep and intuitive understanding of AI, moving away from rote memorization to emphasize real comprehension and application.

Here are the key learning outcomes you can expect from our program:

1. Deep Understanding of some core AI Concepts including basic concepts like machine learning algorithms, neural networks, and data preprocessing, and advanced ones such as deep learning architectures, reinforcement learning, etc.
2. Learning core mathematical concepts like Linear Algebra, Probability, Statistics, and Calculus in the visualization and intuitive mode.
3. Getting Hands-on experience in developing Practical Problem-Solving Skills.
4. Benefit from a structured environment that emphasizes continuous practice and active application of learned skills to solidify your knowledge and expertise in AI.
5. Building Confidence and Proficiency in AI.

We believe that your active involvement is key to leveraging the full potential of this program.


## Expectations from the Participants
---
We encourage active participation in lectures, workshops, and group discussions, fostering curiosity and enthusiasm for AI technologies. While prior AI knowledge isn't mandatory, a basic understanding of programming and math concepts is beneficial. Collaboration and teamwork are key as students work on projects together and share ideas. Creativity is encouraged to approach AI problems innovatively, alongside critical thinking to analyze algorithms critically. We promote a respectful, inclusive environment where everyone's contributions are valued. Students are expected to take responsibility for their learning and be open to feedback for growth. Expect hands-on learning through coding exercises and real-world AI applications. Join us for a rewarding AI journey at IIT Ropar!
