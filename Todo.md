@TAs

Note: Leave it to me if you cannot cover some of the topics. 

# ToDo for TAs

1. Session on basic probability (absolute minimals).
2. Session on functions. How to find minima/maxima of a function. 
3. Session on Geogebra.
4. Teach them: 
	- Matrix multiplication.
	- Determinants.
	- Geometrical meaning of dot product.
	- Matrix Inverse.
	- Finding Eigen Values and Eigen Vectors.
	(All of these should be for 2x2 matrices only).
	Refer to 3blue1brown's youtube channel. Refer to his linear algebra vidoes. They are short and sweet. 

# Project Component
There is a project for 10 marks. Feel free to give them some reading or programming assignment based on the math concepts taught.
