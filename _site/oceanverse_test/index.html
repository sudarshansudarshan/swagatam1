<p>1.Ram and Lakshman were two brothers, Ram’s pocket money was twice as Lakshman. The good boys that Ram and Lakshman were, they did not spend their pocket money on anything. They instead saved the same in their piggy bank. Every week, they would check their savings so far. Assume the first week’s savings was \((R_1,L_1)\) and second week’s \((R_2,L_2)\) and so on. They try plotting their weekly savings on a graph sheet. How will the points look like?</p>
<details closed="">
   <summary>Sol.</summary>

   In GeoGebra, if you plot the weekly savings of Ram and Lakshman on a graph with the x-axis representing Lakshman's savings and the y-axis representing Ram's savings the points will form a straight line. This is because Ram's savings are always proportional to Lakshman's savings.

The points will follow a straight line passing through the origin as:

$$y = 2x$$

<p>2.Atul’s house is centered at origin \((0,0)\) he walks straight (along the x-axis) for 2 units and then takes a left and walks 1 unit to reach Bala’s house, after that he takes a right turn and walks for one unit and then a left turn and walks for one unit and reaches Chetan’s house. He continues in a similar style, takes a right turn 1 unit and then left turn one unit and reaches Divya’s house. Are the houses of Bala, Chetan and Divya on a straight line? What is the equation of this line? Plot this on Geogebra</p>
<details closed="">
   <summary>Sol.</summary>

  <div style="text-align: left;"> Atul starts his journey from the origin \(O = (0, 0).\) He first walks 2 units along the x-axis to reach \((2, 0)\), then takes a left turn and walks 1 unit to reach Bala's house at \((2, 1).\) Next, he continues by taking a right turn from Bala's house and walking 1 unit to \((3, 1),\) followed by another left turn and walking 1 unit to reach Chetan's house at \((3, 2).\) Continuing in the same pattern, Atul takes a right turn from Chetan's house and walks 1 unit to \((4, 2),\) then takes a left turn and walks 1 unit to reach Divya's house at \((4, 3).\)</div>

Now, we will plot these points on GeoGebra and make a line out of them taking two at a time.
We can clearly observe that whether the points make a straight line.

   To plot these lines using GeoGebra, in the input bar at the bottom, type the equations and they will be plotted on the graph.
Using GeoGebra to plot these lines provides a clear visual representation of how different linear equations with varying slopes behave.
We can observe that the line $$y = 10x$$ is the steepest of them all. and the line $$y = x$$ is the shallowest.

   <div style="text-align: left;">All of the lines provided in the previous question are of the form: $$y = kx,$$ where k is 1, 2 and 10.
Here, y is defined as k times x, i.e., when we put \(k = 0,\) y will definitely be 0 as \(0 * t = 0\) for all t belonging to R.
As Origin is \((0,0)\) point, All the lines pass through it.</div>

<details closed="">
   <summary>Sol.</summary>
   
   <div style="text-align: left;">The plotting is done similarly to the previous questions in thew Module.
The line does not pass through the Origin because when x is considered to be 0, y comes out to be 2 * 0 + 1, which gives 1. Hence, it does not pass through the Origin, i.e., \((0,0).\)</div>

<p>6.Plot \(y=ax+b\), with \(a\) and \(b\) as parameters which you should be able to vary. What do you observe?</p>
<details closed="">
   <summary>Sol.</summary>
   
   <div style="text-align: left;">To explore the behavior of the linear equation \(y=ax+b\) with varying parameters \(a\) (slope) and \(b\) (y-intercept) using GeoGebra, you can use sliders to dynamically adjust these values and observe the resulting changes on the graph.
As you adjust the slider for \(a\), you will notice that increasing \(a\) makes the line steeper, while decreasing it makes the line gentler.
Adjusting the slider for \(b\) shifts the entire line vertically. Increasing \(b\) moves the line upwards, while decreasing \(b\) moves it downwards.
This interactive approach in GeoGebra helps visualize and understand how the parameters a and b influence the equation of a line, providing a clear and dynamic way to grasp the fundamental properties of linear equations.</div>

<p>6(a). Let a line be \(y=5x+6\). For what values of \(\alpha\) and \(\beta\) will the line \(y= \alpha x + \beta\) be parallel to the given line? When will it intersect the given line in the 3rd quadrant?</p>
<details closed="">
   <summary>Sol.</summary>
   
   Two lines are only parallel if there slopes are equal. So for the line to be parallel to $$y = 5x + 6,$$ Alpha must be equal to 5, whereas the value of Beta does not change the lines being parallel.
This can be observed by plotting the lines and using sliders on GeoGebra.

For the lines to intersect in third quadrant, solve the two equations and when we will get the values of x and y in the terms of \(\alpha\) and \(\beta\), make both x and y less than 0.
We will get the values of \(\alpha\) and \(\beta\) upon solving the inequalities.

<details closed="">
   <summary>Sol.</summary>

   Yes, I see a 2x2 matrix here. Recognizing the system of equations in matrix form is crucial because it allows us to use matrix operations to solve the system more efficiently, especially when dealing with larger systems. By representing the coefficients of the variables and the constants in matrix form, we can apply many useful techniques to find the solutions. Studying matrices in general is important because they offer a powerful way to represent and manipulate data in various fields. Matrices provide a concise and structured way to represent complex systems and relationships, making it easier to analyze and solve problems.

When we rewrite the system of equations in matrix form, it looks like the matrix equation mentioned in the question.

This representation allows us to apply matrix operations to find the solution to the system of equations.

<p>8.Consider a simple function \(f(x) = 3x+2\). This function is invertible right? Can you tell us what is \(\alpha\) such that \(f(\alpha)=17\)? Is such an \(\alpha\) unique? How did you find such an \(\alpha?\). Is this always possible?</p>
<details closed="">
   <summary>Sol.</summary>

   An invertible function is one that has a unique inverse function, meaning that for every output value of the function, there is exactly one input value that produced it. This property ensures that each y in the function's range corresponds to exactly one x in the domain. So, yes, this function indeed is invertible.
This equation can be solved by putting the value of the function as 17 in the equation and then solving it.
The value of \(\alpha\) comes out to be 5.
Linear functions with non-zero slopes are one-to-one (bijective) and thus have a unique inverse. For any given output y, there is exactly one input x such that f(x)=y.
For such functions, it is always possible to find such a value.

<p>9.Consider the function \(f(x)=x^2-10\), what is \(f(5)\)?</p>
<details closed="">
   <summary>Sol.</summary>

   f(5) signifies the value of the function at x = 5, which is given by x*x - 10, i.e., 25 - 10 = 15.

<p><br /></p>

<p>10.Consider the function \(f(x)=x^2-10\), if \(f(\alpha)=54\), what is \(\alpha\)?</p>
<details closed="">
   <summary>Sol.</summary>

   Here, we have to find x and we know the value of the function. So, 54 = x*x - 10, i.e., x = 8 or -8.

<p>11.Consider the function \(g(x)=x^3-x^2-10x+2\), if \(g(x)=-22\) what is \(x\)?</p>

   <summary>Sol.</summary>

   We can find this by plotting the curve of g(x) + 22 = 0 on GeoGebra and then checking the roots of the equation. On plotting the curve, we observe that it has only one real root and two roots are imaginary as the degree of the equation is 3.

<p>12.Do you know what is \(\mathbb{R}, \mathbb{R}^2 and\ \mathbb{R}^3\) ?</p>

   <div style="text-align: left;">\(R\) represents the set of all real numbers (one-dimensional), \(R^2\) represents the two-dimensional space of ordered pairs of real numbers, and \(R^3\) represents the three-dimensional space of ordered triples of real numbers.</div>

<p>13.Consider the function \(\phi : \mathbb{R}^2\rightarrow \mathbb{R}^2\) defined by \(\phi (x,y)=(2x+3y,3x+4y)\). Find x and y such that \(\phi (x,y)=(5,6)\). Obseve that (5,6) as well as (x,y) lies in \(\mathbb{R}^2\).</p>

<details closed="">
   <summary>Sol.</summary>

   To find the values of \(x\) and \(y\) such that the function \(\varphi: \mathbb{R}^2 \to \mathbb{R}^2\), defined by \(\varphi(x, y) = (2x + 3y, 3x + 4y)\), maps to the point \((5, 6)\), we need to solve the corresponding system of linear equations. Specifically, we set \(\varphi(x, y) = (5, 6)\), which gives us the system of equations: 

  \[
  2x + 3y = 5
  \]
  \[
  3x + 4y = 6
  \]
  
  To solve this system, we can use the elimination method. First, we multiply the first equation by 3 and the second equation by 2 to align the coefficients of \(x\). This yields 
  
  \[
  6x + 9y = 15
  \]
  \[
  6x + 8y = 12
  \]
  
  Next, we subtract the second equation from the first to eliminate \(x\), resulting in 
  
  \[
  6x + 9y - 6x - 8y = 15 - 12
  \]
  
  which simplifies to 
  
  \[
  y = 3
  \]
  
  With \(y\) determined, we substitute \(y = 3\) back into one of the original equations to solve for \(x\). Using the first equation, \(2x + 3(3) = 5\), we get 
  
  \[
  2x + 9 = 5
  \]
  
  Subtracting 9 from both sides, we find 
  
  \[
  2x = -4
  \]
  
  and dividing by 2, we obtain 
  
  \[
  x = -2
  \]
  
  Therefore, the values of \(x\) and \(y\) that satisfy \(\varphi(x, y) = (5, 6)\) are \(x = -2\) and \(y = 3\).
  
  It is important to observe that both the point \((5, 6)\) and the pair \((x, y)\) lie in \(\mathbb{R}^2\). This means that \((5, 6)\) and \((-2, 3)\) are both elements of the two-dimensional real number space, \(\mathbb{R}^2\), which is consistent with the domain and codomain of the function \(\varphi\).

   </details>
<p><br /></p>

<p>14.Is the function \(\phi\) invertible? In the question above on matrices, we see that it is of the form \(A\vec{x}=b\). Note that we can invert the matrix, using the method that was taught to us in our high school to find out the value for the variables \(x\) and \(y\). This is one of the many applications of matrices.</p>

<details closed="">
   <summary>Sol.</summary>

   To determine if the function \(\varphi\) is invertible, we need to analyze the function \(\varphi: \mathbb{R}^2 \to \mathbb{R}^2\) defined by \(\varphi(x, y) = (2x + 3y, 3x + 4y)\). This problem can be expressed in matrix form as \(A \vec{x} = \vec{b}\), where \(A\) is the matrix of coefficients, \(\vec{x}\) is the column vector of variables \((x, y)\), and \(\vec{b}\) is the result vector \((5, 6)\).

  The matrix \(A\) corresponding to the linear transformation is:
  
  \[
  A = \begin{pmatrix}
  2 &amp; 3 \\
  3 &amp; 4
  \end{pmatrix}
  \]
  
  For \(\varphi\) to be invertible, the matrix \(A\) must be invertible. A matrix is invertible if its determinant is non-zero. We calculate the determinant of \(A\):
  
  \[
  \det(A) = \begin{vmatrix}
  2 &amp; 3 \\
  3 &amp; 4
  \end{vmatrix} = (2 \cdot 4) - (3 \cdot 3) = 8 - 9 = -1
  \]
  
  Since the determinant of \(A\) is \(-1\), which is non-zero, the matrix \(A\) is invertible. Consequently, the function \(\varphi\) is also invertible.
  
  To find the inverse function, we use the inverse of the matrix \(A\). The inverse of \(A\) is calculated using the formula for the inverse of a \(2 \times 2\) matrix:
  
  \[
  A^{-1} = \frac{1}{\det(A)} \begin{pmatrix}
  d &amp; -b \\
  -c &amp; a
  \end{pmatrix}
  = \frac{1}{-1} \begin{pmatrix}
  4 &amp; -3 \\
  -3 &amp; 2
  \end{pmatrix}
  = \begin{pmatrix}
  -4 &amp; 3 \\
  3 &amp; -2
  \end{pmatrix}
  \]
  
  Therefore, the inverse function \(\varphi^{-1}\) can be written as:
  
  \[
  \varphi^{-1}(x', y') = \begin{pmatrix}
  -4 &amp; 3 \\
  3 &amp; -2
  \end{pmatrix} \begin{pmatrix}
  x' \\
  y'
  \end{pmatrix}
  = \begin{pmatrix}
  -4x' + 3y' \\
  3x' - 2y'
  \end{pmatrix}
  \]
  
  Applying this to find the values of \(x\) and \(y\) for \(\varphi(x, y) = (5, 6)\):
  
  \[
  \begin{pmatrix}
  x \\
  y
  \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix}
  -4 &amp; 3 \\
  3 &amp; -2
  \end{pmatrix} \begin{pmatrix}
  5 \\
  6
  \end{pmatrix}
  = \begin{pmatrix}
  -4(5) + 3(6) \\
  3(5) - 2(6)
  \end{pmatrix}
  = \begin{pmatrix}
  -20 + 18 \\
  15 - 12
  \end{pmatrix}
  = \begin{pmatrix}
  -2 \\
  3
  \end{pmatrix}
  \]
  
  Thus, \(x = -2\) and \(y = 3\).

<p>14(a). Take a random looking 2*2 matrix. Is it invertible? How often is it invertible?</p>

<details closed="">
   <summary>Sol.</summary>

   To determine whether a random \(2 \times 2\) matrix is invertible, we need to consider the properties of the matrix. A \(2 \times 2\) matrix is invertible if and only if its determinant is non-zero. 

  Let's take a random \(2 \times 2\) matrix:
  
  \[
  A = \begin{pmatrix}
  a &amp; b \\
  c &amp; d
  \end{pmatrix}
  \]
  
  The determinant of this matrix \(A\) is calculated as follows:
  
  \[
  \det(A) = ad - bc
  \]
  
  For the matrix \(A\) to be invertible, \(\det(A)\) must not be equal to zero. Therefore, the condition for invertibility is:
  
  \[
  ad - bc \neq 0
  \]

   </details>
<p><br /></p>

<p>15.We will now see matrices as functions. Instead of \(\phi\) we will write the matrix itself: <br />\(\left( \begin{matrix} 2 &amp; 3 \\3 &amp; 4 \\\end{matrix}\right) : \mathbb{R}^2 \rightarrow \mathbb{R}^2\).</p>

<details closed="">
   <summary>Sol.</summary>

   We can view matrices as functions that map vectors from one space to another. For example, consider the matrix:

  \[
  A = \begin{pmatrix}
  2 &amp; 3 \\
  3 &amp; 4
  \end{pmatrix}
  \]
  
  This matrix \(A\) can be seen as a function \(A: \mathbb{R}^2 \to \mathbb{R}^2\) that takes a vector from \(\mathbb{R}^2\) and maps it to another vector in \(\mathbb{R}^2\). Specifically, for a vector \(\vec{x} = \begin{pmatrix} x \\ y \end{pmatrix}\), the matrix function \(A\) acts on \(\vec{x}\) as follows:
  
  \[
  A \vec{x} = \begin{pmatrix}
  2 &amp; 3 \\
  3 &amp; 4
  \end{pmatrix} \begin{pmatrix}
  x \\
  y

<p>16.Consider the function \(\left( \begin{matrix} 1 &amp; 2 \\2 &amp; 4 \\\end{matrix}\right) : \mathbb{R}^2 \rightarrow \mathbb{R}^2\). This matrix takes a few elements to the origin. What are those elements? Plot this using Geogebra.</p>

<details closed="">
   <summary>Sol.</summary>

   Consider the function represented by the matrix \(A\):

  \[
  A = \begin{pmatrix}
  1 &amp; 2 \\
  2 &amp; 4
  \end{pmatrix}
  \]
  
  This matrix \(A: \mathbb{R}^2 \to \mathbb{R}^2\) maps vectors from \(\mathbb{R}^2\) to \(\mathbb{R}^2\). We are interested in finding which vectors \(\vec{x} = \begin{pmatrix} x \\ y \end{pmatrix}\) are mapped to the origin by this matrix, i.e., we want to solve the equation:
  
  \[
  A \vec{x} = \begin{pmatrix}
  1 &amp; 2 \\
  2 &amp; 4
  \end{pmatrix} \begin{pmatrix}
  x \\
  y
  \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix}
  0 \\
  0
  \end{pmatrix}
  \]
  
  This leads to the system of linear equations:
  
  \[
  \begin{cases}
  1x + 2y = 0 \\
  2x + 4y = 0
  \end{cases}
  \]
  
  We can simplify this system by noting that the second equation is just twice the first equation. Therefore, it suffices to solve the first equation:
  
  \[
  x + 2y = 0 \implies x = -2y
  \]
  
This means that any vector of the form \(\vec{x} = \begin{pmatrix} -2y \\ y \end{pmatrix}\) will be mapped to the origin by the matrix \(A\). In other words, the vectors that are mapped to the origin lie along the line \(x = -2y\).
This line will be called as the Null Space of the Matrix.

<p>17.\(A\) is assigned \(0\), \(B:1\), \(C:2\), and so on up to \(Z:25\)<br />
Assume you denoted every letter with a number, as given in the table above.<br /> You need to encrypt the word \(SUDARSHANA\) which stands for the numbers: \(18, 20, 3, 0, 17, 18, 7, 0, 13,0\). <br />
You encrypt this using a matrix given by : \(\left( \begin{matrix} 2 &amp; 3 \\3 &amp; 4 \\\end{matrix}\right)\). <br />
So \(SUDARSHANA\) will end up becoming: \(96, 134, 6, 9, 88, 123, 14, 21, 26, 39\). <br />
Given these numbers, how will you decrypt the message and get back \(SUDARSHANA\)?<br />. This is a well known cryptographic protocol called the Hill Cipher. You can read more online.</p>
<details closed="">
   <summary>Sol.</summary>

   To decrypt the message encrypted using the Hill Cipher, we need to apply the inverse of the encryption matrix. Given the encrypted numbers representing "SUDARSHANA" as 96, 134, 6, 9, 88, 123, 14, 21, 26, and 39, we first identify the corresponding encryption matrix, denoted as \( \mathbf{E} \), which in this case is \( \begin{pmatrix} 2 &amp; 3 \\ 3 &amp; 4 \end{pmatrix} \). Utilizing this matrix, we compute its inverse, considering modulo 26 arithmetic. The decryption matrix, denoted as \( \mathbf{D} \), is then obtained. Proceeding with decryption, each pair of encrypted numbers undergoes matrix multiplication with \( \mathbf{D} \), followed by modulo 26 reduction. This process retrieves the original numbers corresponding to each letter. The decryption process is represented as \( \mathbf{p} = \mathbf{D} \cdot \mathbf{c} \pmod{26} \), where \( \mathbf{p} \) represents the decrypted numbers and \( \mathbf{c} \) represents the encrypted numbers. Finally, mapping these numbers back to their corresponding letters reveals the decrypted message "SUDARSHANA." This cryptographic protocol, known as the Hill Cipher, leverages linear algebra principles for both encryption and decryption, ensuring a secure communication channel.

<p>18.We encounter equations very often in our lives. Consider for example, the following situation at <strong><em>Baker’s Cafe</em></strong>. The manager has a very important estimate to make. Mostly, visitors at his cafe happen to be families and they are often comprised of Children and/or Adults. He observes that there are 3 adults and 1 child at a table and their bill turns out to be Rs.1200/-. There is yet another table with 2 children and 1 adult and their bill comes out to be Rs.1000/-. Can the manager estimate the consumption of a Child/Adult? This is popularly called the <em>Simultaneous Equations</em> and we all remember from our school days, multiple ways in which these can be solved.<br />
   \(3A + 1C = 1200\) <br />
   \(1A + 2C = 1000\)</p>
<details closed="">
   <summary>Sol.</summary>

   Let's denote the consumption of an adult as \(A\) and that of a child as \(C\).

The first observation, with 3 adults and 1 child resulting in a bill of Rs. 1200, can be expressed as the equation:
\[3A + 1C = 1200\].

Similarly, the second observation, with 2 children and 1 adult totaling Rs. 1000, can be represented as:
\[1A + 2C = 1000\].

To solve this system of equations, we can employ various methods such as substitution, elimination, or matrix methods. The values of \(A\) and \(C\) are determined as \(280\) and \(360\) respectively.

   </details>
<p><br /></p>

<p>19.While we were taught the so called two variables and two unknowns, what if there were more equations than unknowns?<br />

   \(1A + 1C =  900\)</p>
<details closed="">

   When faced with a system of equations where the number of equations exceeds the number of unknowns, we encounter what is known as an overdetermined system. In this scenario, there may not exist a single solution that satisfies all equations simultaneously. For instance, considering the equations provided.
   We have three equations but only two unknowns, A and C. Consequently, the system is overdetermined. In such cases, it is unlikely that a unique solution exists that satisfies all equations simultaneously. However, we can still attempt to find a solution that best fits the given equations. We aim to minimize the error between the observed values (the left-hand sides of the equations) and the predicted values (the right-hand sides) by adjusting the unknowns. Therefore, while the system may not have a single exact solution, we can seek an approximation that minimizes the discrepancy between the observed and predicted values.

   </details>
<p><br /></p>

<p>20.Note that the previous question can be modelled as a matrix:</p>

<p>\(3A + 1C = 1200\) <br />
   \(1A + 2C = 1000\)  <br />
   \(1A + 1C =  900\)</p>

<p><u>Observe</u> this is same as :</p>

<p>\(\left( \begin{matrix} 3 &amp; 1 \\1 &amp; 2 \\1 &amp; 1 \\\end{matrix}\right)\)

   Indeed, the system of equations provided can be represented in matrix form as:
\[

\begin{pmatrix}
A \\
C \\

\begin{pmatrix}

\]

Here, the coefficient matrix on the left represents the coefficients of the unknowns A and C in each equation, while the vector on the right represents the constants on the right-hand side of each equation.

<p>21.One obvious way to solve this, is to guess the values :-). Can you get closer to the solution by guessing? Note that there is no solution to this question. You can just reduce the error. Do you see why?</p>
<details closed="">
   <summary>Sol.</summary>

   In situations where a system of equations is overdetermined, as in the case provided, where there are more equations than unknowns, there may not exist a solution that satisfies all equations simultaneously. Consequently, attempting to solve the system by guessing values is unlikely to yield an exact solution. However, we can employ guesswork to minimize the error between the observed and predicted values, effectively reducing the discrepancy between the equations. By iteratively adjusting the guessed values and evaluating their impact on the overall error, we can approximate a solution that minimizes the discrepancy as much as possible. This process, though not guaranteed to yield a precise solution, allows us to iteratively refine the estimates and improve the fit between the observed and predicted values.

<details closed="">

   The equation given is \( [123]\begin{bmatrix} x \\ y \\ z \end{bmatrix} = 0 \). To solve this, we can multiply the matrix \( [123] \) by the column vector \( \begin{bmatrix} x \\ y \\ z \end{bmatrix} \) using matrix multiplication. 

\[
\begin{bmatrix} 
1 &amp; 2 &amp; 3 \\

For the equation to hold true, the result of this multiplication must be zero. Therefore, the solution to the equation is any vector \( \begin{bmatrix} x \\ y \\ z \end{bmatrix} \) such that \( x + 2y + 3z = 0 \).

   Null Space of a Matrix is defined as the set of points such that their column matrix X when post multiplied by the matrix M itself produces the Null Matrix O of relevant order, i.e., $$MX = O.$$

When we multiply these matrices, we get two equations in two variables.

$$x + 3y = 0$$
$$2x + 6y = 0$$

We can observe that the two equations are same and the solution for the null space of the matrix comes out to be the straight line from the equation, i.e., $$x = -3y.$$

Similarly, we can do it for the transpose matrix of M.

Let the transpose matrix of M be N.
Now, as we learnt earlier, Null space of N will be found by the following equation:
$$NX = O$$

This leads us to the equations:

$$x + 2y = 0$$
$$3x + 6y = 0$$

Similar to the previous example, the solution for the null space for N, the transpose of the matrix M, comes out to be a straight line, $$x = -2y.$$

<details closed="">

   Let us first check the Null Space.
As the square matrix used is of the order of 3 now, not of the order of 2, we will have three equations in 3 variables. But the basic approach for Null Space will be the same, i.e., $$AX = O.$$

We will get the following equations:

$$x + 2y + 3z = 0$$
$$4x + 5y + 6z = 0$$
$$7x + 8y + 9z = 0$$

We can use Geogebra to solve these equations.

We get the solution as: 

$$x = - y/2 = z,$$ which is the null space of the provided matrix.

Similarly, for the transpose of the provided matrix, we will get the following equations:

$$x + 4y + 7z = 0$$
$$2x + 5y + 8z = 0$$
$$3x + 6y + 9z = 0$$

We get the solution as:

$$x = -y/2 = z,$$ which, we can observe, is exactly similar to the Null Space of A itself.

Now, we will check the Column Space of the given matrix.
We have seen how $C(M)$ is defined previously in this module.

Going with the similar approach, we get the set C(A) as:

$$C(A) = \{a(1,4,7) + b(2,5,8) + c(3,6,9) : a, b, c \text{ belong to \} R}$$

   <div style="text-align: left;">\((A)\) Given that the range contains a point \((a,b,c)\), it means that there exists a vector x such that \(A(x) = (a,b,c).\)</div>
But, since A is a linear transformation; for any scalar a, $$A(ax) = a(a,b,c),$$ which implies that the entire set S is also in the range.

<div style="text-align: left;">\((B)\) Similarly, as long as the linearity of the transformation is sustained, $$A(ax + by) = a.x + b.y$$ for 2 scalars a and b and existing vectors \(x = (a,b,c)\) and \*(y = (d,e,f).\) This indicates that the entire set T is in the range.</div>

<div style="text-align: left;">\((C)\) Yes, the dimension of T needn't be 2 as it depends upon the linear dependency of the two vectors with each other.</div>

<p>46.Give an example of two  \(2-dim\) subspaces in \(\mathbb{R^{3}}\). Let us call it \(S_1, S_2\).</p>
<details closed="">
   <summary>Sol.</summary>

   To provide an example of two 2 - dimensional subspaces in 3 - dimensional Real space, we need to define two different planes through the origin in the whole space.
For example, they can be the xy and the zx - planes. Therefore,

$$S_1 = \{(x,y,0) : x,y \text{ belong to } R\}$$
$$S_2 = \{(x,0,z) : x,z \text{ belong to } R\}$$

<details closed="">
   <summary>Sol.</summary>

   <div style="text-align: left;">Let us define \(S_3\) and \(S_4\) on the basis of their orthogonality towards \(S_1\) and \(S_2\) respectively.</div>

<div style="text-align: left;">As \(S_3\) contains all the vectors perpendicular to \(S_1\), i.e., the xy - plane, they will lie along the z-axis. Therefore,</div>
$$S_3 = \{x : x \text{ lies along the z - axis}\}$$

Similarly,
$$S_4 = \{x : x \text{ lies along the z - axis}\}$$

   $$ A=\begin{bmatrix} 1 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 \\ 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 \\ 0 &amp; 1 &amp; 0 \\ \end{bmatrix}$$

As we know that row space and null space of a matrix are orthogonal to each other. It can clearly be observed from this matrix that its row space is xy plane and hence, as z - axis is orthogonal to it, it is its null space.

<p>49.What does \(S_1\) and \(S_4\) represent?</p>
<details closed="">
   <summary>Sol.</summary>

   <div style="text-align: left;">\(S_1\) represents a 2 - dimensional subspace within \(R^3.\)</div>
Specifically, it signifies any plane passing through the origin in 3 - dimensional space.

  <div style="text-align: left;">\(S_4\) represents the orthogonal complement of a 2 - dimensional subspace \((S_2)\).</div>
<div style="text-align: left;">In other words, it consists of all vectors that are perpendicular to every vector in \(S_2\). Geometrically, it could signify a line, a plane, or even all of \(R^3\) itself, depending upon the orientation ad the dimensionality of \(S_2.\)</div>

<div style="text-align: left;">This map pairs each vector in \(S_1\) with a unique vector in \(S_2\) and covers all vectors in \(S_2\) maintaining the conditions of both injectivity and surjectivity.</div>
