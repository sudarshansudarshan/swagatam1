Students have the option to make their own arrangements for accommodation and meals if they prefer.</p>

<p><strong>21. Will we be provided with mattresses in  the hostels?</strong></p>

  <li>Geogebra</li>
</ol>

<p><strong>24. I have exams scheduled during this period. Can I discontinue after joining the Program?</strong></p>

<p>Students with academic commitments between May 15th, 2024, and July 15th, 2024, are not eligible to participate in the program. The NOC provided with the registration form explicitly states that students must not have any concurrent academic obligations during this timeframe. Furthermore, the NOC must be endorsed by the College Administration, affirming the student’s commitment.</p>

<p><strong>25. Is there any placement support provided?</strong></p>

<p>In the latter phase of the program, iHub-AWaDH, the Technology and Innovation Foundation at IIT Ropar, will facilitate connections between students and startups. However, it’s important to note that neither IIT Ropar nor iHub-AWaDH guarantees placements for students enrolled in the program.</p>

<p><strong>26. Is there any possibility of receiving concessions in the program?</strong></p>

<p>Yes, entry to the program is subject to interviews. If we find a candidate with exceptional overall performance, a strong statement of purpose, and who is clearly deserving and if you do well while running that program, we may put their case forward to the committee for consideration of concessions. It’s important to know that there’s no sure thing, and dealing with any changes to manage costs might be tough for us.</p>
